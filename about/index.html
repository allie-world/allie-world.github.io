I’m a marketer based in NYC. Currently I lead social at Hudson River Trading, a quantitative trading firm, where I spend a lot of time thinking about how to nerd-snipe the smartest technologists with content that feels warm, smart, and human. On any given day, this might involve creative strategy, production, copywriting, design, and frequent Googling. (What are FLOPs, exactly?)
I like working on small teams who embrace tight deadlines and the challenge of getting the attention of people who are very good at ignoring marketing. </br></div></body>
