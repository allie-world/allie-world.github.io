I'm a marketer based in NYC. Currently I lead social at Hudson River Trading, a quantitative trading firm, where I spend a lot of time thinking about how to nerd-snipe the smartest technologists with content that feels warm, smart, and human. This involves creative strategy, production, copywriting, design, and frequent Googling. (What are FLOPs, exactly?) </br> 
I like working on small teams with tight deadlines, thinking hard about how to get the attention of people who are very good at ignoring marketing. </br>
